Elliptic curves are (more or less) the set of points described by the equation y^2=x^3+ax+b
    - 4a^3 + 27b^2 != 0 yields singularities like cusps and self-intersections
    - we also need an infinity point, whatever that means, denoted {0}

Formally, elliptic curves satisfy:
    {x,y element R^2 | y^2 = x^3 + ax + b, 4a^3 + 27b^2 != 0} Union {0}

Group is a set of elements and a binary operation satisfying:
    1. closure: a and b in G then a + b in G
    2. associativity: a, b, c in G then (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
    3. identity exists: i in G s.t a + i = a
    4. inverse: for all a in G, there exist b s.t a + b = 0

Abelian Group is a commutative group. i.e a + b = b + a

Back to elliptic curves:
all points on an elliptic curve are a group, the operator is point addition
    - takes two points on an elliptic curve and produces a third point on the same curve
    - straight line through the 2 points gives a third intersecting point with the curve
    - three aligned points added = 0. i.e p + q + r = 0 for aligned p,q,r
    - the above gives us associativity since p+(q+r) and (p+q)+r are both equal to 0
    - and commutativity since p+q+r and q+p+r are both equal to 0
    - 0 (infinity) is defined as the identity. p+0=p
    - inverse of p is -p


the important property is that:
    - it is easy to check whether p + q + r = 0
    - it is difficult to find r given p and q, which requires solving a cubic

    ex. p = (1,2) and q = (3,4) for curve y^2=x^3-7x+10. is -r=(-3,2) -> r=(-3,-2) aligned?
        - (4-2)/(3-1) the m=1
        - 2=1*1+b then b=1
        - p+q=-r i.e -2=1*-3+1=-2 

to calculate the third point, simply
    - xr = m^2 - xp - xq
    - yr = curve(xr) = yp + m(xr-xp)

on the curve, multplication by a scalar is p*3 = p+p+p, which is n-additions.
    - double and add algorithm makes it faster


secp256k1, the bitcoin curve, is a specific elliptic curve. y^2 = x^3 + 7

The above is a description of the reals, but we will actually use finite fields
    - same as above, except mod some prime (p)

What does it mean for points to be aligned mod p? 
    - a line is the set of points that satisfy ax + by + c = 0 mod p
    - this is standard line equation mod p
    - visually, the line just wraps around at y = p, with the same slope

To calculate the third point, just add mod p at each step from before
